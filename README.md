### Glad to see you here! &nbsp; <!-- ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=mail4hafij.mail4hafij&style=flat-square&color=0088cc) -->

I have a master’s degree in computer & System Science 🎓 from Uppsala University 🏛 (also a PhD candidate). I have been working in software development in various roles (system developer, senior system developer, software architecture developer, tech lead, etc.) over the last 10 years.

Pragmatic and I believe that IT is a fantastic tool and there shouldn't be any religion when choosing which technology to use.
